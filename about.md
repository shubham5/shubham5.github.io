Hi, thanks for stumbling by on my website. My name is Shubham and I work as a Product Manager at one of India's biggest stock brokers. I'm a curious individual interested in stock markets, mathematics, philosophy, sports, technology and everything under the sun.
I was an active quizzerin my college days and can still be found reading and sharing obscure trivia all the time.
